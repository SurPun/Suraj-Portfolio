      <h3>Welcome to my software development portfolio!</h3>

      <p>
        I recently completed the Founders and Coders bootcamp, a highly
        regarded, intensive program that trains individuals to become full-stack
        web developers. Throughout the course, I gained a solid foundation in
        modern web development technologies and practices, including HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, Node.js, and React.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to the technical skills I acquired during the bootcamp, I
        also developed strong problem-solving and communication skills. I am
        comfortable working in a team environment and have experience
        collaborating on projects using agile development methodologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to work on a number of
        real-world projects, including a web application for organizing and
        managing events, a social media platform for posting song recommendations, and an Immersive empathy training web application. These projects allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge in a
        practical setting and demonstrate my ability to deliver high-quality software.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am now excited to take my skills and passion for software development
        to the next level. I am eager to find new challenges and opportunities
        to grow as a developer and contribute to innovative projects. If you
        have a project that could benefit from my skills and enthusiasm, please
        don't hesitate to reach out.
