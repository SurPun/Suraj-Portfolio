      <h3>Welcome to my software development portfolio!</h3>

      <p>
        I recently completed the Founders and Coders bootcamp, a highly
        regarded, intensive program that trains individuals to become full-stack
        web developers. Throughout the course, I gained a solid foundation in
        modern web development technologies and practices, including HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, Node.js, and React.
